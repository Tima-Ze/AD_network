# AD_network

This repository contains all the scripts used to generate gene co-expression networks and perform downstream analyses linked to [paper title and DOI]. Please note that the embedded data provided here is a sample dataset.

## **Network Analysis**

The repository includes scripts for analyzing consensus networks. The **Data** folder contains sample data to be used as input for the scripts, while the **Result** folder contains the outputs generated by running the scripts using this sample data.

Scripts should be run in the specified order, as the output files from one script are used as input for the next. The scripts are intentionally kept simple and not fully automated, allowing users to follow the process step-by-step and verify the results at each stage.
