# AD_network

This repository contains all the scripts used to generate gene co-expression networks and perform downstream analyses linked to [paper title and DOI]. Please note that the embedded data provided here is a sample dataset.

Please follow this order to use the scripts:

1. **Network Construction** (`network_construction`)
2. **Network Analysis** (`network_analysis`)
3. **data deconvolution** (`data_deconvolution`)

## **Network construction**

The entire process for constructing wTO networks, filtering links with a cut-off, and integrating networks into consensus networks is embedded in a single Nextflow file. Due to the high computational demands, this script is designed to be executed on a SLURM cluster. You will need a Conda environment to run the script. For further instructions, please refer to the README file in the `network_construction` directory.

## **Network Analysis**

The repository includes scripts for analyzing consensus networks. The **Data** folder contains sample data to be used as input for the scripts, while the **Result** folder contains the outputs generated by running the scripts using this sample data.

Scripts should be run in the specified order, as the output files from one script are used as input for the next. The scripts are intentionally kept simple and not fully automated, allowing users to follow the process step-by-step and verify the results at each stage.

## **Data deconvolution**

This repository includes scripts for bulk RNA-seq data deconvolution, aimed at determining cell-type proportions within each bulk RNA-seq sample using single-cell data as a reference. To begin, you need to generate a signature matrix from the single-cell gene-expression dataset relevant to your study. The single-cell data are preprocessed using the `Seurat` R package, where cell-type clusters are identified and saved as a Seurat object. This object can then be used to generate the signature matrix. Finally, the `CIBERSORT` R package uses this signature matrix to estimate cell-type proportions for each bulk RNA-seq sample. In this project, I used the CIBERSORT source scripts due to technical issues encountered during data processing.
